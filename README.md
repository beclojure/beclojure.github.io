# Belgium Clojure User Group

## Welcome

We are a group of human people interested in promoting the Clojure ecosystem in Belgium.

We have regular in-person meetups featuring pizza, coffee, tea and - it's Belgium - some beers

There is a Slack channel to keep in touch at other times

Until we fix the domain, the web site is at https://beclojure.github.io
